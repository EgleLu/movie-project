            <p class="font5"> Published: 2018-10-31</p>
            <p class="font4">A new movie called A Simple Favor is a funny, twisty, surprising blend of mystery and light social satire. It’s never believable, not even for a moment—but then, what comedy-thriller ever is? The whole conceit of the comedy-thriller is weird when you think about it; someone usually dies horribly in the course of such a movie, and yet the overall mood is supposed to remain peppy and light.<a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal2">... </a> <p>

                      <img class="newsImg" src="img/cinema2.jpg">
                      <p class="font4">A Simple Favor sets its insouciant tone immediately with a dazzlingly new-old-fashioned credit sequence that evokes the great early 1960s titles designed by the Hollywood master Saul Bass. The screen seems to dance as it splits and splits again, alternating images of high fashion and suburban motherhood, all set to the rhythm of a French pop song. Director Paul Feig is telling us at the outset that his movie is a jape and that we’re not to take what happens all that seriously—even though there are disappearances and corpses and fires at Gothic manses straight out of Jane Eyre. By the end, when a staged murder-suicide is interrupted by a moment of bonding between a stay-at-home mom and a working-outside-the-home mom, we’ve long passed from the dark universe of Gone Girl to the more amusing precincts of Feig’s Bridesmaids. A Simple Favor is about Stephanie (Anna Kendrick, wonderful as usual), the single mom so participatory and overeager that she has to be told by her first-grade son’s teacher not to put her name down for every volunteer job on the sign-up sheet. Her desperate desire to pitch in is matched in intensity by the insistently chipper tone of the YouTube vlog she produces daily with cooking and organizing tips for fellow moms. Stephanie’s fellow parents in their tony Connecticut suburb 90 minutes outside New York City watch her vlog to mock her.</p>

                      <p class="font4">It feels like The Hunger Games books and films have been in our lives forever. In reality, the first installment of the mega-popular novels hit bookshelves ten years ago and the first movie adaptation premiered in theaters back in 2012. But it's been a good chunk of time, so who can blame us for getting a little nostalgic? It’s the young adult dystopian blockbuster franchise that defined a genre and introduced us to a cast of now familiar faces, from leading lady Jennifer Lawrence to the incomparable Amandla Stenberg.Don’t get us wrong – our hopes for a Hunger Games prequel or spin-off series haven’t died yet, even if JLaw isn’t 100 percent on board. But it’s never too early for a walk down memory lane. Here’s what the actors behind all your favorite characters have been up to over the past couple of years.
                      Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) The role of Katniss Everdeen propelled Jennifer from indie movie ingenue to Girl on Fire. At age 22, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her stunning performance opposite Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook. Since then, she’s delivered nothing but box office bangers. In addition to playing Mystique in three X-Men movies, she’s starred in American Hustle, Joy, Passengers, and most recently, Mother! TLDR; Jlaw is one of the highest paid and most versatile actors working today.</p>

                      And then ... silence. There's no satisifying answer. As far as family-viewing holiday films go, Thanksgiving is nearly as under-represented as Whacking Day. You could program 12 straight days’ worth of Christmas movies, from It’s a Wonderful Life to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians to Elf. Independence Day has, well, Independence Day. You could even celebrate Easter by throwing on the gorgeous but terrifying rabbit-tale Watership Down, providing you hate your children.
                      When it comes to go-to crowd-pleasing Thanksgiving entries, though, the pickings are slim. The default answers are usually the Steve Martin/John Candy delightful travelogue Planes, Trains and Automobiles or Jodie Foster’s Home for the Holidays, a 1995 comedy-drama about a tumultuous get-together. They’re both fine entries, but neither is exactly made for family viewing: Home features more squabbling than gobbling, while Planes is rated R, mostly because of a bunch of Fs).</p>

                      CineConcerts and Warner Bros. Consumer Products announced the Harry Potter Film Concert Series, a new global concert tour celebrating the Harry Potter films, in 2016. Since the world premiere of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Concert in June 2016, more than half a million fans have enjoyed this magical experience from J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, which is scheduled to include over six-hundred performances across more than 38 countries worldwide through 2018.
                      "We're excited to have the Harry Potter Film Concert Series back at Ovens Auditorium for the second year," says Bojangles' Coliseum and Ovens Auditorium General Manager Cathy Buchhofer. "It's an honor to be the location where this iconic movie series is brought to life with a live symphony performance. It's truly an amazing experience for our guests."
                      In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, cars fly, trees fight back and a mysterious house-elf comes to warn Harry Potter at the start of his second year at Hogwarts. Adventure and danger await when bloody writing on a wall announces: The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. To save Hogwarts will require all of Harry, Ron and Hermione's magical abilities and courage. Earning a Grammy nomination for the score, the incredible music composed by John Williams became an instant classic, conjuring beautiful and soaring motifs continuing the adventures of Harry Potter on his magical journey.</p>

                      <p class="font4">Ralph Breaks the Internet continued to lead the competition at the box office this weekend, while Creed II surpassed the domestic total of Rocky Balboa. Typically, the Thanksgiving window was jam-packed with several movies looking to make a splash over the holidays. Some of these projects, like the latest Robin Hood retelling, crashed and burned, but others had very lucrative weekends. Ralph and Creed were two sequels that outperformed their predecessors, riding waves of positive buzz and capitalizing on brand interest.
                        There's usually a bit of a slowdown at the multiplex between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as the first couple of weekends following Turkey Day primarily consist of lower-profile offerings that are just filling a void until the bigger holiday movies come out. That was certainly the case this weekend, and the top of the charts was dominated by the holdovers.       Related: Ralph Breaks the Internet's Post-Credits Scenes Explained
                        According to Box Office Mojo, Ralph Breaks the Internet earned $25.7 million domestically in its second weekend, a 54.2 percent decrease from its debut. The animated film is now up to $119.2 million domestically, ahead of the pace of the original (which grossed $101 million through 12 days). The other noteworthy box office development was Creed II raising its Stateside haul to $81.1 million, moving it past Rocky Balboa ($70.2 million) on the all-time franchise chart. It'll pass Rocky II shortly and then set its sights on the first Creed.</p>
